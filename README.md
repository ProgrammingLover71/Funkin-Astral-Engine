# Friday Night Funkin' — Astral Engine
**Astral Engine** is a 100% Python recreation of Friday Night Funkin' (currently based on FnF 0.7.5), that aims to add multiple Quality of Life (QoL) features, such as:
- *better scoring*,
- *more in-game stats*,
- *better menus*, and
- *multiplayer*, \n
while also introducing cool stuff like revamped menus, editors, easier mod structure, and most importantly... \n
*performance*.

# Installing
Just download the source code for the latest release, extract it from the .zip file, and you're done!

# Contributions
**All contributions are welcome!** If you've got a bug report (or even a fix for said bug/bugs), an idea or you found a piece of code that isn't doing its thing, feel free to submit it as an issue, and it will be resolved as quickly as possible.

# Modding
The engine is in a pretty unstable state, but full built-in mod support will come soon, probably with release 0.4.0 (?).

Oh, and if you want to change the source or redistribute the engine, go wild. Just don't forget to credit me and the other developers of the engine (which, as of right now, *don't exist*)!

Have fun and happy funkin'!
